## What is stacking?

Stacked changes (or "stacked diffs") is a development workflow where you break a large feature into small, focused branches that build on top of each other. Instead of one massive Pull Request, you have a "stack" of smaller PRs.

!!! tip "Why use stacking?"

    - **Faster Reviews**: Reviewers can process small, 50-line PRs much faster than a single 500-line PR
    - **Parallel Work**: Don't wait for a PR to merge before starting the next part of your feature
    - **Incremental Shipping**: Parts of a feature can be merged and deployed as they are approved
    - **Cleaner History**: Each PR represents a logical step in your feature's development

### The Stacked Workflow

    B2 --- B3[PR 3: UI Components]
    B2 --- B4[PR 4: CLI Support]
    B3 --- B5[PR 5: Integration Tests]

Stacks naturally form a tree structure—a single branch can have multiple children when you need to work on parallel features. Stackit manages the complexity of this workflow—automatically handling rebases, keeping track of parent-child relationships, and submitting the entire stack to GitHub with a single command.
