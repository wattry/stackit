# Stack Fix

Diagnose stack problems and apply the smallest safe repair.

## Workflow

1. Inspect:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   stackit log --no-interactive
   stackit doctor --no-interactive
   ```

2. If an operation is in progress, inspect conflicts and route to `stack-resolve`.

3. If branches need ancestry repair, run:

   ```bash
   stackit restack --upstack --no-interactive
   ```

4. If the last Stackit operation clearly caused the problem and rollback is safest, ask before:

   ```bash
   stackit undo --no-interactive --yes
   ```

5. Verify with `stackit log --no-interactive` and the lightest relevant build/test command.

Do not delete branches or undo work without explicit user approval.
