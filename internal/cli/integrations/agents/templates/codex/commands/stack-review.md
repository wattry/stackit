# Stack Review

Review stack PRs for high-confidence issues and report findings locally.

## Workflow

1. Gather stack PRs:

   ```bash
   stackit log --json --no-interactive
   ```

2. For each open non-draft PR selected for review:

   ```bash
   gh pr view <branch> --json state,isDraft,number,url,headRefName
   gh pr diff <number>
   ```

3. Review only for high-confidence problems:

   - Compilation or parsing failures.
   - Definitive logic bugs.
   - Clear project-instruction violations.
   - Security vulnerabilities.

4. Do not report style preferences, speculative risks, or nits.

5. Return findings first, ordered by severity, with file and line references.

If no issues meet the bar, say so and mention residual test gaps.
