# Stack Tidy

Squash branches whose history is dominated by fixup, WIP, or noise commits, leaving a clean per-branch story.

## Workflow

1. Inspect:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   stackit log --no-interactive
   stackit info --stack --json --no-interactive
   ```

2. If there are uncommitted changes, stop and ask whether to commit, stash, or abort.

3. For each non-trunk branch in the stack, list its commits:

   ```bash
   git log --format="%H %s" <parent>..<branch>
   ```

4. Classify each commit:

   - **Cleanup/noise**: starts with the autosquash markers **fixup!** or **squash!**; case-insensitive match on `wip`, `tmp`, `temp`, `fix`, `oops`, `typo`, `lint`, `fmt`, `cleanup`, `nit`, `tweak`; contains phrases like `fix typo`, `address review`, `review feedback`, `lint fix`, `formatting`; or any single-word message under 10 characters.
   - **Meaningful**: matches Conventional Commits (`type(scope): desc`), is the first commit on the branch, or has a descriptive message over 15 characters that does not match cleanup patterns.

5. Pick a per-branch strategy:

   | Branch state | Strategy |
   |---|---|
   | 0 or 1 commits | skip |
   | 1 meaningful + only noise | squash, keep the meaningful message |
   | 0 meaningful, all noise | squash, keep oldest message |
   | 2+ meaningful commits | leave for manual review |

6. Show the user the full plan: per branch, the commits with classification, the proposed action, and the message that will land.

7. Wait for explicit user approval before any squash. If the user asks to review one branch at a time, confirm each before squashing.

8. Execute bottom-up (closest to trunk first). For each squash branch:

   ```bash
   stackit checkout <branch> --no-interactive
   stackit squash --no-edit --no-interactive
   ```

   When a meaningful message should replace the existing one:

   ```bash
   printf '%s\n' "<meaningful message>" | stackit squash -F - --no-interactive
   ```

9. Verify:

   ```bash
   stackit log --no-interactive
   ```

## Do Not

- Squash a branch the user has not approved.
- Squash branches with only one commit.
- Process top-down — children before parents corrupts ancestry.
- Modify branches flagged for manual review.
- Use `git rebase -i`; use `stackit squash`.
