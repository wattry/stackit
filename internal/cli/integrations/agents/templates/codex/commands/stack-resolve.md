# Stack Resolve

Resolve an in-progress Stackit conflict and continue the operation.

## Workflow

1. Inspect:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
   stackit log --no-interactive
   ```

2. Read each conflicted file and resolve markers.

3. Stage resolved files:

   ```bash
   git add <resolved-files>
   ```

4. Continue:

   ```bash
   stackit continue --no-interactive
   ```

5. If another conflict appears, repeat.

6. Verify with `stackit log --no-interactive` and the relevant check command.

Use `stackit abort --no-interactive` only if the user asks to abort.
