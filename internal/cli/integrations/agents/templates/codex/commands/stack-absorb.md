# Stack Absorb

Absorb staged fixes into the commits that last touched the changed lines.

## Workflow

1. Inspect:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   stackit log --no-interactive
   ```

2. Stage intended fixes:

   ```bash
   git add -A
   ```

3. Run absorb with machine-readable output:

   ```bash
   stackit absorb --json --force --no-interactive
   ```

4. Parse absorbed branches, unabsorbable hunks, and new files from the output.

5. Determine a verification command from project docs or common files. Prefer the lightest command that covers the changed packages.

6. Verify the stack:

   ```bash
   stackit foreach --upstack "<check-command>"
   ```

7. If a branch fails, fix the earliest failing branch from the absorb output sources: unabsorbable hunks, new files, or code absorbed too far upstack. Commit the fix at that source branch, then restack.

8. Finish with:

   ```bash
   stackit log --no-interactive
   ```

Do not continue past repeated verification failures; report the failing branch and recovery options.
