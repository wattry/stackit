# Stackit - Stacked Branch Management

You are an expert at using Stackit to manage stacked Git branches. Stackit helps developers break large features into small, focused PRs that stack on top of each other.

## Before Any Operation

**Always run `stackit log --no-interactive` first** to understand:
- Current branch position in the stack
- Parent/child relationships
- Which branches need attention

**CRITICAL: Non-Interactive Mode**
When calling `stackit` commands, **ALWAYS** include the `--no-interactive` flag. This ensures the command fails or proceeds according to defaults rather than hanging for user input. For commands that require confirmation, include the `--force` flag (for absorb) or `--yes` flag (for undo/merge) in addition to `--no-interactive`.

**Check for project conventions:**
- Read `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for project-specific guidelines before generating commit messages or branch names.
- Follow documented commit message formats, PR templates, and workflows.
- Respect any branching or testing requirements specified.

## Quick Health Check

Run the stack analyzer to check health and get actionable suggestions:
```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/stackit/scripts/analyze_stack.sh
```

> **Note:** All stackit commands below should be called with `--no-interactive`.

## Core Workflows

### Creating a New Branch

1. **Stage changes:** `git add <files>` or use `--all` flag
2. **Generate commit message** after checking `README.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md`; follow project conventions if documented, otherwise write a clear, descriptive summary.
3. **Create branch** (name optional, auto-generated from message and respects `stackit config branch.pattern`):
   ```bash
   # Preferred: pipe format
   echo "commit message" | stackit create --no-interactive

   # With explicit name
   echo "commit message" | stackit create branch-name --no-interactive
   ```
4. If currently on trunk (e.g., main/master), warn and confirm or switch to a feature branch before creating.
5. Show stack: `stackit log --no-interactive`

### Submitting PRs

1. Check stack state: `stackit log --no-interactive`
2. Submit options:
   - Current + ancestors: `stackit submit --no-interactive`
   - Entire stack: `stackit submit --stack --no-interactive`
   - As drafts: `stackit submit --draft --no-interactive`

### Syncing with Main

1. Sync with trunk and cleanup: `stackit sync --no-interactive`
2. If branches were deleted: `stackit restack --no-interactive`

### Fixing Issues

- **Rebase conflicts:** Resolve files, then `stackit continue --no-interactive`
- **Absorb conflicts:** See [workflows/absorb-conflict.md](workflows/absorb-conflict.md) or use `stackit absorb --show-conflict --no-interactive`
- **Abort operation:** `stackit abort --no-interactive`
- **Undo last command:** `stackit undo --no-interactive --yes`
- **Stack health issues:** See [workflows/fix-absorb.md](workflows/fix-absorb.md) or run `/stack-fix`
- **Intelligent folding:** See [workflows/stack-fold.md](workflows/stack-fold.md) or run `/stack-fold`

## Commit Message Examples

Generate commit messages following these patterns:

**Example 1: Feature addition**
```
feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware.
Supports refresh tokens and role-based access.
```

**Example 2: Bug fix**
```
fix(cache): prevent race condition in invalidation

Add mutex locking around cache clear operations.
Fixes issue where concurrent requests could see stale data.
```

**Example 3: Multiple changes**
```
chore: update dependencies and refactor errors

- Upgrade lodash to 4.17.21
- Standardize error response format
- Add error codes for API responses
```

**Format:**
- Follow project conventions from README.md/CONTRIBUTING.md if documented
- Otherwise: clear, descriptive subject line + blank line + explanation of "why"
- Some projects use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

## Command Reference

For detailed command information, see:
- **Navigation:** [commands/navigation.md](commands/navigation.md) - log, checkout, up, down, trunk
- **Branch operations:** [commands/branch.md](commands/branch.md) - create, modify, absorb, delete
- **Stack operations:** [commands/stack.md](commands/stack.md) - restack, submit, sync, foreach
- **Recovery & utilities:** [commands/recovery.md](commands/recovery.md) - undo, continue, abort, doctor

Quick reference: [reference.md](reference.md)

## Detailed Workflows

For complex operations requiring multiple steps:
- **Fixing compilation errors after absorb:** [workflows/fix-absorb.md](workflows/fix-absorb.md)
- **Resolving conflicts during rebase:** [workflows/conflict-resolution.md](workflows/conflict-resolution.md)
- **Resolving absorb conflicts:** [workflows/absorb-conflict.md](workflows/absorb-conflict.md)

## Auto-Generation Guidelines

### Branch Names
Branch names are **optional** - stackit auto-generates from commit message:
- Only provide if user explicitly requests a specific name
- Auto-generated format: kebab-case from commit message
- Example: "Add user authentication" → "add-user-authentication"

### Commit Messages
When generating commit messages:
1. Check README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md for project guidelines
2. Follow documented conventions if available
3. If no conventions documented, write a clear, descriptive message
4. **Always use pipe format:** `echo "message" | stackit create --no-interactive`

**Validation loop:**
- Generate message
- Verify: Clear description? Follows project conventions (if documented)?
- If fails: revise and re-validate
- Only proceed when message meets quality standards

### PR Descriptions
When generating PR descriptions:
1. Check for .github/pull_request_template.md or CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Follow project-specific templates if available
3. Default format:
   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   - Bullet point summary of changes

   ## Test Plan
   - [ ] Specific testing steps
   - [ ] Verification procedures

   [Additional sections per project templates]
   ```

**Validation before submission:**
- Title is clear and descriptive?
- Body has meaningful content (not placeholders)?
- Test plan is specific?
- Use `bash ~/.claude/skills/stackit/scripts/validate_pr.sh "title" "body"` to validate

## Important Rules

1. **Never use raw git for branch operations** - always use stackit commands
2. **Check state before destructive operations** - run `stackit log` first
3. **Always validate after absorb** - absorb can cause compilation errors, see fix-absorb workflow
4. **Handle conflicts gracefully** - guide user through resolution, see conflict-resolution workflow
5. **Keep PRs small and focused** - suggest splitting if too large
6. **Use validation loops** - for commit messages, PR descriptions, and post-absorb builds
