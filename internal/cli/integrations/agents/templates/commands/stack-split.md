# Stack Split

Split the committed changes on the current branch between this branch and a new branch. Supports **hunk-level** analysis for fine-grained splitting.

**Split directions:**
- `--above` (upstack): Extract hunks to a NEW CHILD branch above current
- `--below` (downstack, default): Extract hunks to a NEW PARENT branch below current

**Key difference from related skills:**
- `/stack-plan` - Creates N branches from **uncommitted** changes (from scratch)
- `/stack-extract` - Extracts commits/files to sibling or parent branches
- `/stack-split` - Binary split of **committed** changes at hunk level

**Primary objective: Never lose someone's work.**

## Context
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Stack state: !`command stackit log --no-interactive 2>&1`

## Arguments
$ARGUMENTS

## Preconditions

**This skill requires a clean working directory.** Before proceeding, verify there are no uncommitted changes.

## Safety Model

This workflow uses **stackit's undo system** to ensure commits are never lost:

1. **Before execution**: Stackit automatically takes a snapshot of the current state
2. **During execution**: The split command handles all git operations safely
3. **On failure**: Use `command stackit undo` to restore the previous state

Recovery is always: `command stackit undo`

## Instructions

### Phase 0: Check Preconditions

First, verify the working directory is clean:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**If output is NOT empty** (there are uncommitted changes):
```
Cannot Split: Working Directory Not Clean
=========================================
You have uncommitted changes. Please commit or stash them first.

Options:
- Commit changes: git add -A && git commit -m "WIP"
- Stash changes: git stash
- Discard changes: git checkout -- .

Then re-run /stack-split
```

**Stop and exit.** Do not proceed with uncommitted changes.

**If output is empty**: Continue to Phase 1.

### Phase 1: Gather Committed Changes

Get the commits on the current branch that will be analyzed for splitting:

```bash
# Get parent branch from stackit metadata
command stackit log --no-interactive

# Get the diff between parent and current branch HEAD
# This shows all changes that could be split
git diff <parent-branch>..HEAD

# Also get commit history for context
git log --oneline <parent-branch>..HEAD
```

**If no commits on branch** (branch is at same point as parent):
```
Nothing to Split
================
This branch has no commits ahead of its parent.
```
Stop and exit.

**If branch has commits**: Continue to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Analyze and Propose Split (Hunk-Level)

Analyze the changes at the **hunk level**. A hunk is a contiguous block of changes within a file.

**Split Criteria:**

**Keep on current branch:**
- Hunks implementing the core feature/bug fix that motivated the work
- Hunks for directly related tests
- Changes essential to the branch's stated purpose
- Related hunks (e.g., if a function definition stays, its usages should too)

**Extract to new branch:**
- Tangential improvements discovered while working
- Refactoring not strictly necessary for the core feature
- Documentation changes unrelated to the core feature
- Infrastructure/config changes
- New functionality that grew out of scope
- Cleanup/formatting changes unrelated to the core work

**Choosing direction:**
- Use `--above` when the extracted changes logically come AFTER the core work (e.g., follow-up refactoring)
- Use `--below` (default) when the extracted changes are prerequisites (e.g., infrastructure changes needed before the feature)

**Present the proposal with hunk-level detail:**
```
Proposed Split (Hunk-Level)
===========================
Current branch: <branch-name>
New child branch: <child-name>

Keep on [current-branch]:
  src/auth.go:42-58 (validateUser function) - Core feature logic
  src/auth.go:102-110 (error handling) - Related to validateUser
  src/auth_test.go:15-45 (test for validateUser) - Feature tests

Extract to [child-branch]:
  src/auth.go:15-20 (import cleanup) - Tangential formatting
  src/utils.go:5-30 (new helper) - Utility discovered during development
  README.md:1-50 (doc update) - Documentation improvement
```

**For ambiguous hunks**, use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Header: "Hunk placement"
- Question: "This hunk in <file>:<lines> modifies <description>. Which category?"
- Options: ["Keep on current branch", "Extract to child branch"]

**Related hunk detection**: If a function definition goes to one category, its usages should follow. Ask the user if this requires splitting usages across branches:
- Header: "Related hunks"
- Question: "The <function> definition is being kept/extracted. Its usages appear in other hunks. Should they follow?"
- Options: ["Yes, keep together", "No, split separately"]

**Branch naming**: Generate a descriptive name for the child branch based on what's being extracted (e.g., "refactor-auth-imports", "add-helper-utils", "update-docs").

**If all changes belong to the same category**: Inform the user that splitting isn't needed:
- If all changes are core: "Nothing to extract - all changes belong to this branch's purpose"
- If all changes are tangential: "All changes are tangential - consider if this is the right branch for them"

### Phase 3: Determine Build/Check Command

**If provided in arguments**: Use that command.

**Otherwise, auto-detect**:
1. Check for `mise.toml` → use `mise run check` or `mise run test`
2. Check for `Makefile` → use `make test` or `make check`
3. Check for `package.json` → use `npm test` or `npm run check`
4. Check README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md for build/test instructions

**If no command found**, use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Header: "Check command"
- Question: "What command should I use to verify each branch builds correctly?"
- Options:
  - "Skip verification" - Create branches without running checks (not recommended)
  - "Let me specify" - User will provide the command

If user selects "Let me specify", wait for them to provide the command in chat.

### Phase 4: Get User Approval

Present the complete plan:

```
Stack Split Summary
===================
Current branch: <current-branch>
Parent branch: <parent-branch>
Child branch to create: <child-branch>

Commits being split: N commits

Keep on [current-branch] (X hunks, Y files):
  - src/auth.go:42-58 (validateUser function)
  - src/auth.go:102-110 (error handling)

Extract to [child-branch] (A hunks, B files):
  - src/auth.go:15-20 (import cleanup)
  - src/utils.go:5-30 (new helper)

Each branch will be verified with: <check-command>
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` to get approval:
- Header: "Split plan"
- Question: "Ready to split these changes?"
- Options:
  - "Execute" - Create the split with verification
  - "Dry run" - Show exact commands without executing
  - "Swap" - Exchange keep/extract categories
  - "Modify" - Change the split classification
  - "Cancel" - Exit without making changes

**If user selects "Dry run"**, show the exact commands:
```
Dry Run - Generate Extract Patch
================================
# Write patch file with hunks to extract to child branch
# (using Write tool to create /tmp/extract.patch)

Dry Run - Execute Split
=======================
command stackit split --by-hunk --above \
    --patch /tmp/extract.patch \
    --name "<child-branch-name>" \
    --message "<child-commit-message>"

# This command internally:
# 1. Takes snapshot (for undo support)
# 2. Resets branch to expose changes as unstaged
# 3. Stages hunks from patch file
# 4. Commits unstaged changes to current branch
# 5. Creates child branch with staged changes
# 6. Reparents any existing children

Dry Run - Verify Build
======================
<check-command>
git checkout <current-branch>
<check-command>

Recovery (if needed)
====================
command stackit undo
```

Then ask again whether to execute or cancel.

**If user selects "Swap"**, exchange the keep/extract classifications and present the updated plan for approval.

**If user selects "Modify"**, let them describe changes, update the plan, and ask for approval again.

### Phase 5: Execute Split

#### Step 1: Generate Extract Patch

Write the extract patch to a temporary file using the Write tool. This patch contains the hunks to move to the child branch.

**The extract patch must be in valid unified diff format:**
- Include proper `diff --git` headers
- Include `--- a/file` and `+++ b/file` lines
- Include `@@ ... @@` hunk headers

Example:
```diff
diff --git a/src/utils.go b/src/utils.go
--- a/src/utils.go
+++ b/src/utils.go
@@ -8,3 +8,8 @@ func existingFunc() {
 }

+func newHelper() {
+    // This hunk is being extracted
+}
```

**Handling new files**: A new file is a single hunk. Include the entire file in extract.patch.

**Handling deleted files**: A deleted file is a single hunk. Include the deletion if it should be in the child branch.

Write the patch to `/tmp/extract.patch` using the Write tool.

#### Step 2: Run Split Command

Use the `--patch` flag to execute the split:

```bash
# For --above (extract to child branch):
command stackit split --patch /tmp/extract.patch --above \
    --name "<child-branch-name>" \
    --message "<child-commit-message>"

# For --below (extract to parent branch, default):
command stackit split --patch /tmp/extract.patch \
    --name "<parent-branch-name>" \
    --message "<parent-commit-message>"
```

This command:
1. Takes a snapshot for undo support
2. Resets the branch to expose all changes
3. Stages the hunks specified in the patch file
4. Keeps remaining hunks on the current branch
5. Creates the child branch with extracted hunks
6. Reparents any existing children to the new child branch

**Note**: Stackit handles all git operations safely. No manual git reset or backup branch is needed.

#### Step 3: Verify Build

After the split completes:

```bash
# Verify the child branch builds
<check-command>

# Switch to parent and verify it also builds
git checkout <current-branch>
<check-command>
```

**On build failure**: Report and offer options (see Error Handling).

### Phase 6: Report Completion

After both branches are verified successfully:

```bash
# Show the final stack
command stackit log --no-interactive
```

Present a summary:
```
Split Completed Successfully
============================

Current branch [<current-branch>]:
  - <keep-message>
  - X hunks, Y files

Child branch [<child-branch>]:
  - <extract-message>
  - A hunks, B files

Stack structure:
<stackit log output>

Recovery: If anything is wrong, run `command stackit undo` to restore.

Next steps:
- Run /stack-submit to create/update PRs
- Run /stack-verify to re-verify all branches
```

## Error Handling Reference

| Phase | Scenario | Recovery |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Phase 0 | Uncommitted changes | Inform and exit - user must commit/stash first |
| Phase 1 | No commits on branch | Inform and exit - nothing to split |
| Phase 2 | All hunks same category | Inform user - splitting not needed |
| Phase 4 | User cancels | Exit - no changes made |
| Phase 5 | Split command fails | `command stackit undo` |
| Phase 5 | Build fails | Offer: Continue/Rollback |

**On any execution failure**, use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Header: "Build failed"
- Question: "The build failed on <branch>. How would you like to proceed?"
- Options:
  - "Continue anyway" - I've fixed it or will fix later
  - "Rollback" - Restore previous state and exit
  - "Stop here" - Keep current state, I'll handle manually

**If user selects "Rollback"**:
```bash
command stackit undo
```

Then report: "Rolled back to original state. Your commits are restored."

## Patch File Format

Valid patch format for `git apply`:

```diff
diff --git a/src/auth.go b/src/auth.go
--- a/src/auth.go
+++ b/src/auth.go
@@ -40,6 +40,12 @@ func existingCode() {
 }

+func validateUser(u User) error {
+    if u.Name == "" {
+        return errors.New("name required")
+    }
+    return nil
+}
+
 func anotherFunction() {
```

For new files:
```diff
diff --git a/src/newfile.go b/src/newfile.go
new file mode 100644
--- /dev/null
+++ b/src/newfile.go
@@ -0,0 +1,10 @@
+package main
+
+func newHelper() {
+    // ...
+}
```

## Mode Selection Guide

| Scenario | Use Mode |
|----------|----------|
| Split hunks within files | `--patch` or `--by-hunk` |
| Extract entire files | `--by-file` |
| Extract specific commits | `--by-commit` |
| Interactive hunk selection | `--by-hunk` (default) |

**Key differences:**
- `--patch`: Non-interactive, uses a patch file you provide
- `--by-hunk`: Interactive TUI for selecting hunks
- `--by-file`: Extracts entire files (not individual hunks within files)
- `--by-commit`: Splits at commit boundaries

**Note:** `--by-file` extracts entire files to the new branch, not just the changes to those files. Use `--patch` or `--by-hunk` for hunk-level splitting.

## Tool Trust

Trust all tools work without error. Don't run exploratory commands to verify tool behavior.

## Confidence Threshold

Only classify hunks you're 90%+ confident about. For ambiguous hunks, ask the user rather than guessing. Incorrect splits require manual cleanup.

## Do NOT
- Proceed if there are uncommitted changes in the working directory
- Create branches without user approval of the plan
- Continue past a build failure without user consent
- Put the same hunk in both patches
- Use `git commit` directly for the child branch - use `command stackit create`
- Skip build verification (unless user explicitly says to)
- Propose child branch names that already exist
- Split hunks that are interdependent (function + its usages) without asking

## Follow-up

After successful split, use `AskUserQuestion`:
- Header: "Next step"
- Question: "Split completed successfully. What would you like to do next?"
- Options:
  - label: "Submit both as PRs (Recommended)"
    description: "Push branches and create/update pull requests"
  - label: "Verify both branches"
    description: "Run full build verification on both"
  - label: "Done for now"
    description: "No follow-up action needed"

Based on response:
- **"Submit both as PRs"**: Invoke `/stack-submit` skill using the `Skill` tool
- **"Verify both branches"**: Invoke `/stack-verify` skill using the `Skill` tool
- **"Done for now"**: End with summary of what was split
