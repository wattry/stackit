# Stack Create

Create a new stacked branch on top of the current branch.

## Context
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Staged changes: !`git diff --cached --stat`
- Staged diff: !`git diff --cached | head -200`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -3 2>&1`
- Stack state: !`stackit log --no-interactive 2>&1`

## Arguments
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. If no staged changes, ask what to stage or offer `git add --all`
2. If on trunk (main/master), confirm user wants to proceed
3. Generate a commit message:
   - Analyze the staged diff to understand what changed
   - Check README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md for commit conventions
   - Consider matching the style of recent commits if present
4. Run: `echo "commit message" | stackit create [branch-name] --no-interactive`
   - Branch name is optional; stackit auto-generates from commit message
5. Show new stack state

## Do NOT
- Proceed without staged changes
- Skip reading project conventions if they exist
