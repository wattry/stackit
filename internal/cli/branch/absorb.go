Relevance is calculated by checking the changes in each commit downstack from the current commit,

If there is no clear commit to absorb a hunk into, it will not be absorbed.

Prompts for confirmation before amending the commits, and restacks the branches upstack of the current branch.

If absorb encounters a merge conflict, use 'stackit abort' to restore the original state.
Use --show-conflict to see the current conflict state and what changes were being applied.`,
