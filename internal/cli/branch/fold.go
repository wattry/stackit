of the new combined branch, and restack.

This is useful when you have a branch that is no longer needed and you want to
combine its changes with its parent branch.

If the parent of the current branch is the trunk (e.g., main), you must provide
the --allow-trunk flag, as this will modify your local trunk branch directly.

This command does not perform any action on GitHub or the remote repository.
If you fold a branch with an open pull request, you will need to manually
close the pull request.`,
