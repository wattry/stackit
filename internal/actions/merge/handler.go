// EventHandler is the interface for reporting merge progress using events.

//  1. Start() is called once when the merge plan is ready
//  2. EmitEvent() is called for each step (started, completed, failed, waiting)
//  3. Complete() is called once when the operation finishes
//  4. Cleanup() should be called via defer to restore terminal state
//
// Thread safety: All methods may be called from different goroutines.
// Implementations should handle synchronization internally.

	// May be called concurrently from multiple goroutines.
