# Stackit

[![Tests](https://github.com/jonnii/stackit/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jonnii/stackit/actions/workflows/test.yml)

**Stackit** is a command-line tool that makes working with stacked changes fast and intuitive.

## What is Stacking?

Stacked changes (or "stacked diffs") is a development workflow where you break a large feature into a sequence of small, focused branches that build on top of each other. Instead of one massive Pull Request, you have a "stack" of smaller PRs.

### How it helps engineers:

- **Faster Reviews**: Reviewers can process small, 50-line PRs much faster than a single 500-line PR.
- **Parallel Work**: You don't have to wait for a PR to be merged before starting the next part of your feature. Just stack a new branch on top.
- **Incremental Shipping**: Parts of a feature can be merged and deployed as they are approved, reducing the risk of large, complex merges.
- **Cleaner History**: Each PR represents a logical step in your feature's development, making the Git history easier to follow.

### The Stacked Workflow

    B2 --> B3[PR 3: UI Components]
    B3 --> B4[PR 4: Integration Tests]

```

Stackit manages the complexity of this workflow—automatically handling rebases, keeping track of parent-child relationships, and submitting the entire stack to GitHub with a single command.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install jonnii/tap/stackit
```

After installation, you can use either `stackit` or `st` (short alias).

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Stackit
In your repository, run:
```bash
stackit init
```
This detects your trunk branch (usually `main`) and prepares the repo for stacking.

### 2. Create your first branch
Stage some changes, then create a branch:
```bash
git add internal/api.go
stackit create add-api -m "feat: add base api"
```

### 3. Stack another branch on top
Make more changes and create another branch:
```bash
git add internal/logic.go
stackit create add-logic -m "feat: implement logic"
```

### 4. Visualize the stack
See your current position in the stack:
```bash
stackit log
```
```
main
│
├─◯ add-api
│ │
│ └─● add-logic ← you are here
```

### 5. Submit your PRs
Submit the entire stack to GitHub:
```bash
stackit submit
```
This pushes both branches and creates two PRs on GitHub, with `add-logic` correctly pointing its base to `add-api`.

### 6. Merge your stack
Once your PRs are approved, merge the entire stack:
```bash
stackit merge
```
This merges all approved PRs in your stack, bottom-up, and cleans up the merged branches.

## Common Workflows

### Updating after Code Review
If you receive feedback on a branch in the middle of your stack:
1. `stackit checkout <branch>` to move to that branch.
2. Make your changes and run `stackit modify`.
3. Run `stackit restack` to update all child branches.
4. Run `stackit submit` to update the PRs on GitHub.

### Using `stackit absorb`
`absorb` is like magic for stacked PRs. If you have small fixes for multiple branches in your stack, just stage them all and run `stackit absorb`. Stackit will figure out which changes belong to which branch and amend them automatically.

### Syncing with the Main Branch
To keep your stack up-to-date with `main`:
```bash
stackit sync
```
This pulls the latest changes from `main`, deletes branches that have already been merged, and restacks your remaining branches on top of the new `main`.

### Automation & CI
Stackit is designed to be easily scriptable. Use global flags to control behavior in non-interactive environments:

```bash
# Run stackit on a specific repository from a script
stackit sync --cwd /path/to/repo --no-interactive --no-verify
```

## Configuration

Stackit supports several configuration options that can be managed via `stackit config`:

| Option | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `branch.pattern` | Customize how branch names are generated when not explicitly specified | `stackit config set branch.pattern "{username}/{date}/{message}"` |
| `submit.footer` | Control whether PRs include a footer linking back to the stack | `stackit config set submit.footer true` |

### Interactive Configuration
Use the interactive TUI to manage all settings:
```bash
stackit config
```

### List Current Configuration
View all current configuration values:
```bash
stackit config --list
```

## Requirements

- **Git 2.25+**
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** for PR operations
- **Go 1.25+** (if building from source)

## Development

```bash
# Run tests and linter
just check

# Build locally
just build
```

## Philosophy

1. **Safety First**: Operations are non-destructive and can be undone with `stackit undo`.
2. **Speed**: Common operations should be fast and require minimal context switching.
3. **Visibility**: You should always know exactly where you are in your stack.
4. **Git Native**: Stackit uses standard Git refs and metadata under the hood.

## Hack on Stackit

### Building from Source

Requires Go 1.25+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonnii/stackit
cd stackit
go build -o stackit ./cmd/stackit
# Move to your PATH
mv stackit /usr/local/bin/
```

### Using Just

If you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed:

```bash
just build
just install
```

The `just build` command will also create a local `st` symlink for convenience.

### Development

```bash
# Run tests and linter
just check

# Build locally
just build
```
