# Stackit

[![Tests](https://github.com/getstackit/stackit/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/getstackit/stackit/actions/workflows/test.yml)

**Stackit** is a command-line tool that makes working with stacked changes fast and intuitive.

## What is Stacking?

Stacked changes (or "stacked diffs") is a development workflow where you break a large feature into a sequence of small, focused branches that build on top of each other. Instead of one massive Pull Request, you have a "stack" of smaller PRs.

### How it helps engineers:

- **Faster Reviews**: Reviewers can process small, 50-line PRs much faster than a single 500-line PR.
- **Parallel Work**: You don't have to wait for a PR to be merged before starting the next part of your feature. Just stack a new branch on top.
- **Incremental Shipping**: Parts of a feature can be merged and deployed as they are approved, reducing the risk of large, complex merges.
- **Cleaner History**: Each PR represents a logical step in your feature's development, making the Git history easier to follow.

### The Stacked Workflow

    B2 --> B3[PR 3: UI Components]
    B3 --> B4[PR 4: Integration Tests]

Stackit manages the complexity of this workflow—automatically handling rebases, keeping track of parent-child relationships, and submitting the entire stack to GitHub with a single command.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install getstackit/tap/stackit
```

After installation, you can use either `stackit` or `st` (short alias).

### Shell Integration (Recommended)

Enable shell integration to automatically change directories when creating worktrees with `stackit create -w`. Add one of the following to your shell configuration:

```bash
# For zsh (~/.zshrc):
eval "$(stackit shell zsh)"

# For bash (~/.bashrc):
eval "$(stackit shell bash)"

# For fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish):
stackit shell fish | source
```

This is separate from shell completions. You likely want both:

```bash
# zsh example:
eval "$(stackit completion zsh)"
eval "$(stackit shell zsh)"
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Initialize Stackit
In your repository, run:
```bash
stackit init
```
This detects your trunk branch (usually `main`) and prepares the repo for stacking.

### 2. Create your first branch
Stage some changes, then create a branch:
```bash
git add internal/api.go
stackit create add-api -m "feat: add base api"
```

### 3. Stack another branch on top
Make more changes and create another branch:
```bash
git add internal/logic.go
stackit create add-logic -m "feat: implement logic"
```

### 4. Visualize the stack
See your current position in the stack:
```bash
stackit log
```
```
main
│
├─◯ add-api
│ │
│ └─● add-logic ← you are here
```

### 5. Submit your PRs
Submit the entire stack to GitHub:
```bash
stackit submit
```
This pushes both branches and creates two PRs on GitHub, with `add-logic` correctly pointing its base to `add-api`.

### 6. Merge your stack
Once your PRs are approved, merge the entire stack:
```bash
stackit merge
```
This merges all approved PRs in your stack, bottom-up, and cleans up the merged branches.

- **Guide Through Issues**: When conflicts or errors occur, commands provide step-by-step resolution guidance
- **Ensure Safety**: All commands prioritize data safety and provide undo capabilities

### Example Claude Workflow

```bash
# Claude can help with complex stacking operations
stack-create add-user-auth    # Creates branch with proper commit message
# Make changes...
stack-absorb                 # Intelligently distributes changes across commits
stack-fix                    # Diagnoses and fixes any issues
stack-submit --stack         # Creates/updates all PRs in the stack
```

## Common Workflows

### Updating after Code Review
If you receive feedback on a branch in the middle of your stack:
1. `stackit checkout <branch>` to move to that branch.
2. Make your changes and run `stackit modify`.
3. Run `stackit restack` to update all child branches.
4. Run `stackit submit` to update the PRs on GitHub.

### Using `stackit absorb`
`absorb` is like magic for stacked PRs. If you have small fixes for multiple branches in your stack, just stage them all and run `stackit absorb`. Stackit will figure out which changes belong to which branch and amend them automatically.

### Syncing with the Main Branch
To keep your stack up-to-date with `main`:
```bash
stackit sync
```
This pulls the latest changes from `main`, deletes branches that have already been merged, and restacks your remaining branches on top of the new `main`.

### Working on Multiple Stacks in Parallel
To work on separate features simultaneously, each in their own directory:
```bash
# Create a new stack with its own worktree
stackit create my-feature -m "feat: start new feature" -w

# This creates:
# - A new branch 'my-feature' tracked by stackit
# - A worktree at ../your-repo-stacks/my-feature/
```
Navigate to the worktree with:
```bash
cd $(stackit worktree open my-feature)
```
Worktrees are automatically cleaned up during `stackit sync` when their stack is merged.

### Collaborating on Stacks
To work on a stack created by someone else or on another machine:
```bash
# Sync an entire stack by providing a PR number or branch name
stackit get 123
```
By default, `get` **freezes** the fetched branches locally. This prevents accidental local modifications while you build on top of them, without affecting the original author's metadata. Use `stackit unfreeze` if you need to modify them.

---

## Frozen & Locked Branches

Stackit provides two ways to protect branches from accidental modification.

### Frozen Branches (Local)
**Frozen** status is strictly **local** to your machine. It's the recommended way to protect branches you've fetched from others.
- **Use Case**: You want to stack your own work on top of someone else's PRs without accidentally changing their commits.
- **Behavior**: Prevents `modify`, `squash`, `absorb`, and `restack`. `st sync` will update frozen branches by hard-resetting them to their remote tracking branch instead of rebasing.
- **Commands**: `st freeze`, `st unfreeze`

### Locked Branches (Shared)
**Locked** status is **shared** with everyone collaborating on the stack via remote metadata.
- **Use Case**: You want to signal to your team that a set of branches are stable and should not be modified by anyone.
- **Behavior**: Same restrictions as frozen branches, but visible to all users who `st get` or `st sync` the stack.
- **Commands**: `st lock`, `st unlock`

---

### Automation & CI
Stackit is designed to be easily scriptable. Use global flags to control behavior in non-interactive environments:

```bash
# Run stackit on a specific repository from a script
stackit sync --cwd /path/to/repo --no-interactive --no-verify
```

---

## Configuration

Stackit supports several configuration options that can be managed via `stackit config`:

| Option | Description | Example |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `branch.pattern` | Customize how branch names are generated when not explicitly specified | `stackit config set branch.pattern "{username}/{date}/{message}"` |
| `submit.footer` | Control whether PRs include a footer linking back to the stack | `stackit config set submit.footer true` |
| `worktree.basePath` | Customize where worktrees are created | `stackit config set worktree.basePath "../my-stacks"` |
| `worktree.autoClean` | Auto-remove worktrees for merged stacks during sync (default: true) | `stackit config set worktree.autoClean false` |

### Interactive Configuration
Use the interactive TUI to manage all settings:
```bash
stackit config
```

### List Current Configuration
View all current configuration values:
```bash

## Requirements

- **Git 2.25+**
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** for PR operations
- **Go 1.25+** (if building from source)

## Development

```bash
# Run tests and linter
just check

# Build locally
just build
```

## Philosophy

1. **Safety First**: Operations are non-destructive and can be undone with `stackit undo`.
2. **Speed**: Common operations should be fast and require minimal context switching.
3. **Visibility**: You should always know exactly where you are in your stack.
4. **Git Native**: Stackit uses standard Git refs and metadata under the hood.
